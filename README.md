# LD38 - Space Cowboy's Last Stand

Steve the space cowboy lives on the moon. For some reason, aliens have decided to attack. Not one to back from a fight, Steve whips out his trusty revolver and gets to work. Fight the invading aliens, use their scrap to either build more ammo, replenish Steve's health, or replenish the health of the moon, and try to last as long as possible! Created for Ludum Dare 38.
